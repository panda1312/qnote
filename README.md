# QuickNotes 📝

A simple full-stack note-taking app built with **React (frontend)** and **Flask (backend)**.

This project is designed as a hands-on starter for practicing full-stack development using Docker and REST APIs.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Flask + Flask-CORS
- **Database**: In-memory (can be upgraded)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧪 Option 1: Run Locally (Without Docker)

1. **Backend Setup**

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The backend will start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5111)

2. **Frontend Setup**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3111)

---

### 🐳 Option 2: Run with Docker Compose

From the root folder:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3111](http://localhost:3111)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:5111/api/notes](http://localhost:5111/api/notes)

---

## 🔍 API Endpoints

### `GET /api/notes`

Returns all saved notes.

### `POST /api/notes`

Create a new note:
```json
{
  "text": "My first note"
}
```

---

## 🧠 Features

- Add and view notes
- React state management with `useState` and `useEffect`
- RESTful Flask API
- Cross-Origin setup with `Flask-CORS`
- Docker support for full-stack containerization

---

## ✅ Future Ideas

- Persist notes using SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Add user login with JWT
- Edit/Delete notes
- Deploy to Fly.io, Heroku, or TrueNAS
